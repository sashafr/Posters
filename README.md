plugin-Cart
==============
This plugin for [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) is a modification of the [Posters](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-Posters) plugin that allows users to create and save "carts" of Omeka items.

[View the plugin in action here](http://pennds.org/archaebot_database/)

Extension of the Posters plugin:
* Users can now add an item to their "cart" from the item/show page or the item/browse page

## Requirements

Tested on Omeka 2.5 | Built on Posters 1.0.1

This plugin requires [Guest User](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/guest-user/) to be installed. 

## Installation

* Download zip file and upload it your to your Omeka installation's `plugins` directory. Unzip the folder and rename it "Cart". Then install through the Omeka Dashboard.

    **or**

* On the command line, navigate to the `plugins` directory of your omeka installation and run `git clone https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/plugin-Cart.git`. Rename the folder to "Cart". Then install the plugin through the Omeka Dashboard.

*Note: There are minimal changes to the term "posters" throughout the code (replacing it with "cart), with the hope that it will be easy to merge any updates to the Posters plugin.*
